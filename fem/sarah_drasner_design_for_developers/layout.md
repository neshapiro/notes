# Layout

One of the most important concepts of design.

## Grids

Why do we talk about grids when we talk about layouts?

- Grid systems are common because they bring order to chaos. It brings disparate things together.
- Look at ancient city planning - we use grids to help people be able to locate things.
- Grids are the base concept of the layout so that you can play around with just a few blocks to see what works best.

## Balance and Symmetry

Having something be balanced and harmonious on both sides. It's common in art, architecture,

You can have introduce subtle asymmetry into symmetry to keep the rhythm of your eye moving. This is significant. If something is perfectly symmetrical expect for one aspect, your eye will almost be pulled to it.
Websites absolutely do this. Highly symmetrical sites will pull your attention to things like call to actions.
Symmetrical sites are nice, but they can be a bit boring. You won't go telling anyone they have to go see a symmetrical site.

## Balance and Asymmetry

Asymmetry isn't as common because it's harder. Creating balance in an asymmetrical canvas can be tricky. It asks you to be more thoughful about your space and to be careful about how you balance your canvas.

There was a study on the greatest compositions where they showed people painting after painting, and people preferred a composition similar to Van Gogh's Starry Night where there is balance between a structure and and object (building and moon, tree and sun, etc.). People gravitate towards asymmetrical canvases. There is beauty in imperfections.

The world as we see it is naturally not symmetrical. Both Eastern and Western prints pay a ton of attention to balance in asymmetry.
This balance in asymmetry is a very distinct choice and makes a huge difference.
The Sydney Opera House uses this concept of balance in asymmetry.

There are amazing site designs that are again and again using balnce in asymmetry. [Orizon design on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/Orizon) does a really good job of maintaining balance. While we might need to create the grid, properly breaking out of that grid can have a huge impact on your design. Make a system to create recognition. Break the system to get attention.

## Rule of Thirds

If you take a composition and break it into thirds, making the image focused on one of those thirds instead of in the middle will help the composition a great deal.

Triad compositions is a concept where your composition forms a triangle. It's very intentional and there are lots of medieval texts about this because it keeps your eye from leaving the canvas because your eye doesn't just drop off. This is really common. Look for it!

## Swiss Design

Famous for using large flat geometric shapes. Swiss design is not subtle. It obviously, cleanly makes and breaks grids.
