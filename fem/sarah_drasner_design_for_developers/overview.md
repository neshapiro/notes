## Right Brain vs Left Brain

This is a myth. There are tons of supporting articles that say this split is not true, [like this one from Harvard](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/right-brainleft-brain-right-2017082512222), or this one from [Encyclopedia Brittanica](https://www.britannica.com/story/are-there-really-right-brained-and-left-brained-people), or [this one from OECD](http://www.oecd.org/education/ceri/neuromyth6.htm). I hear they have smart people there.

Just because you're good at one thing doesn't mean you can't be good at another. It's not impressive for a developer to be bad at design, but some wear it like a badge of honor. It doesn't make them a better developer, it just means they're bad at design.
Actually, the more you learn to use your brain in different types of ways, the stronger your brain becomes. Solving different problems challenges your brain and lets you see things in another perspective.

## About this course

This course is not a replacement for design school or spending many years in the field. A lot of this can be an entire course in itself.

This course is

- Education on how to think with a design mindset, and resources to further learning.
- Understand base concepts of design.
- Great resource for side projects so you can illustrate your dev concept in an impressive way.
- Allow you to start from concept to execution.

## Perfection

Things might not always turn out the way you intended. Your won't immediately look like Spotify or Dribble and that's okay.
It takes bad designs to make good designs. Keep trying and keep working at it.

### Book referral - Art and Fear

    The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality.

    His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pound of pots rated an “A”, forty pounds a “B”, and so on. Those being graded on “quality”, however, needed to produce only one pot – albeit a perfect one – to get an “A”.

    Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work – and learning from their mistakes – the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.

## Designer vs Developer

Sarah thinks of herself as a developer who can design. She creates designs so people get more interested in her code. The coolor it looks, the more likely someone is to engage with the code itself even if the code is great. She was an art professor though (with a masters in Art) so she's kinda cheating.

This slide had a cool rippling water effect that I might want to use as inspiration for my personal site.

## Project structure

- dev/ eventually the github repo
- insp/ inspiration for your site
- src/ for actual source images and font

## General Notes

Think about things separately. Layout vs colors vs typography, etc.
Fun fact - Sarah's favorite period for prints is the edo period, hence her twitter name [@sarahedo](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo)
