# Masks

`if (activePandemic) wearMask();`

Masks in design are use to provide shapes. SVGs do this amazingly well, but there are other options as well.
[CSS and SVG Masks](https://codepen.io/yoksel/pen/fsdbu) documents a bunch of ways to accomplish this and includes browser support! Yoksel, the creator, has a really cool [showcase on CodePen](https://codepen.io/yoksel) as well!

## SVGs

SVGs are a vector format that allows you to highly customize shapes. SVGs are commonly used throughout the web.

Browser support is great.

## Clip Path

CSS has a clip-path property that is used pretty often but browser support isn't great.
[Clippy](https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/) is a tool that will help you generate this code based on your needs.
