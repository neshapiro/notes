# Comparisons
- Create React App is an opinionated boilerplate, that doesn't really add new functionality. Just manages your build system mostly. Still have decisions to make on things like the router. Doesn't include server side rendering or API routes.
- Gatsby is more similar, but leans heavily into GraphQL. Not a full stack framework, doesn't handle things like API routes. Does offer client side routing and static site generation. Might even have better support than Next.js for things like sourcing content, building documentation, or other static things.

# When to use Next.js
- If you only need a single page app, use Create React App.
- If you need a static site, like a blog, that's also a SPA use Next.js or Gatsby.
- If you need SSR, an API, and all of the above use Next.js.
