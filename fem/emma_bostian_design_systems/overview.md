# General Notes

Emma provided a [good list of Design Systems](https://fem-design-systems.netlify.app/design-systems) to reference and also shared that there is a [Design System Repo](https://designsystemsrepo.com/) that would serve as a great reference for designs.

Gatsby also a good option for Style Guide. Documentation can still be written in MDX. They have a starter file for a blog which is really similar.

React Styleguides also a good tool.
