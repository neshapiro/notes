# General Notes

Emma provided a [good list of Design Systems](https://fem-design-systems.netlify.app/design-systems) to reference and also shared that there is a [Design System Repo](https://designsystemsrepo.com/) that would serve as a great reference for designs.

* Gatsby also a good option for Style Guide. Documentation can still be written in MDX. They have a starter file for a blog which is really similar.
* React Styleguides also a good tool.
* VSCode has a cool extension named Material Icon Theme for your folder structure!
* To create a new folder and file at the same time, use `Create new file` and add both (ex. `components/Button.js`)
